<span class="markdown">

<p>The Battery module of the FEDECOM ontology provides a structured and interoperable model for describing batteries, covering their identity, chemistry, performance, operational behaviour, and lifecycle aspects. It supports both static attributes and dynamic characteristics such as charge/discharge behaviour, voltage relations, state indicators, and degradation factors, following a consistent characteristic‑centric design.</p>

<p>Integration with the FEDECOM Units module ensures uniform representation of quantitative data.</p> </span>
