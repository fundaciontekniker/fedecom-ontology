<span class="markdown">
The Measurement module of the FEDECOM ontology provides a structured and interoperable model for representing quantitative observations within energy systems. It defines measurements together with their properties, directions, identifiers, API‑related metadata, and scaling or temporal parameters. It also models the agents that produce measurements and the properties being measured, enabling consistent handling of energy‑related data streams across pilots and platforms.</span>
