<span class="markdown">
The Energy Asset module of the FEDECOM ontology provides a unified and interoperable way to describe energy‑related devices and systems. It models their key characteristics —such as capacity, efficiency, operating limits, and power ratings— and supports a wide range of asset types including HVAC equipment, boilers, PV systems, meters, storage tanks, chargers and more. Its characteristic‑centric structure and integration with other FEDECOM modules ensure consistent and extensible asset descriptions.</span>
